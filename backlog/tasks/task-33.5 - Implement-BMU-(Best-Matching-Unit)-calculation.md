## Description

Implement efficient Best Matching Unit search using TensorFlow.js operations. Optimize for batch processing and GPU acceleration. Handle distance calculations for both single samples and batches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BMU calculation for single sample works
- [ ] Batch BMU processing implemented
- [ ] Distance computation optimized with tf.matMul
- [ ] GPU acceleration utilized
- [ ] Tensor memory management optimized
- [ ] Performance benchmarked against reference
