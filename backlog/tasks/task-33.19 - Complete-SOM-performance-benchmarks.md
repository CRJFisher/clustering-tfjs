## Description

Implement comprehensive performance benchmarks for SOM that were skipped in Task 33.14. Measure training time, memory usage, and scalability across different dataset sizes and compare CPU vs GPU performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark suite implemented
- [ ] Training time measurements documented
- [ ] Memory usage profiled
- [ ] GPU vs CPU compared
- [ ] Scalability tests completed
- [ ] Performance report generated
