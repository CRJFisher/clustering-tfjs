## Description

Create performance benchmarks comparing TensorFlow.js SOM against reference implementations. Measure training time, memory usage, and scalability across different dataset sizes and grid configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark suite implemented
- [ ] Training time measurements documented
- [ ] Memory usage profiled with tf.memory()
- [ ] GPU vs CPU performance compared
- [ ] Scalability tests completed
- [ ] Performance report generated
