## Description

Mexican hat (Ricker wavelet) neighborhood function appears oversimplified. Need proper implementation with lateral inhibition - positive influence near BMU and negative influence at medium distances.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Correct Ricker wavelet formula implemented
- [x] Lateral inhibition working (negative values)
- [x] Parameter tuning for sigma implemented
- [x] Tests validate shape of influence function
- [x] Comparison with reference implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Proper Ricker Wavelet Implementation
The Mexican hat function was oversimplified. Now implements the correct Ricker wavelet formula with proper lateral inhibition.

### Formula Used
```
h(d, σ) = A * (1 - (d/σ)²) * exp(-(d/σ)²/2)
```
Where:
- d = distance from BMU
- σ = neighborhood radius
- A = amplitude factor (set to 2.0 for stronger effect)

### Key Features
1. **Positive center**: Strong positive influence at BMU (d=0)
2. **Negative surround**: Negative values at medium distances for lateral inhibition
3. **Zero at infinity**: Approaches zero for large distances
4. **Normalized distance**: Distance normalized by sigma for scale invariance

### Improvements
- Uses correct Ricker wavelet mathematical formula
- Provides true lateral inhibition with negative values
- Amplitude scaling for stronger competitive learning
- Better biological plausibility (mimics cortical organization)
