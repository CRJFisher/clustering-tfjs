## Description

Implement various decay strategies for learning rate and neighborhood radius using TensorFlow.js operations. Support linear, exponential, and inverse time decay functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Linear decay strategy implemented with tf operations
- [ ] Exponential decay strategy implemented
- [ ] Inverse time decay strategy implemented
- [ ] Custom decay function support added
- [ ] Decay scheduling tracked across epochs
- [ ] TensorFlow.js tensors used throughout
