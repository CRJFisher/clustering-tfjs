## Description

Implement various decay strategies for learning rate and neighborhood radius using TensorFlow.js operations. Support linear, exponential, and inverse time decay functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Linear decay strategy implemented with tf operations
- [x] Exponential decay strategy implemented
- [x] Inverse time decay strategy implemented
- [x] Custom decay function support added
- [x] Decay scheduling tracked across epochs
- [x] TensorFlow.js tensors used throughout

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive decay strategies to `src/clustering/som_utils.ts`:

### Decay Functions
1. **Linear Decay**: Smooth linear transition from initial to final value
2. **Exponential Decay**: Natural exponential decay with configurable rate
3. **Inverse Time Decay**: 1/(1 + rate*t) decay pattern

### Key Features
- `createDecayScheduler()`: Factory function for creating decay schedulers
- `decayTensor()`: GPU-accelerated decay computation using TensorFlow.js
- `DecayTracker` class: Tracks decay history across epochs
- Support for custom decay functions via DecayFunction type

### Adaptive Functions
- `adaptiveRadius()`: Automatically adjusts radius based on grid size
- `adaptiveLearningRate()`: Standard learning rate decay

All functions support both CPU (number) and GPU (tensor) computation modes for maximum flexibility.
