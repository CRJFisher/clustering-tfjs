## Description

Create grid initialization methods for rectangular and hexagonal topologies. Implement weight initialization strategies including random, linear (along principal components), and PCA-based initialization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hexagonal grid topology implemented
- [ ] Random initialization working
- [ ] Linear initialization along PCs implemented
- [ ] PCA-based initialization functional
- [ ] Grid coordinate system established
