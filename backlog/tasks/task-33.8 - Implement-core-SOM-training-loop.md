## Description

Implement the main training loop with batch processing support using TensorFlow.js. Include epoch management, weight updates, convergence monitoring, and early stopping based on quantization error.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Training loop with tf.tidy memory management
- [ ] Batch processing implemented
- [ ] Weight update mechanism using tf operations
- [ ] Convergence monitoring functional
- [ ] Early stopping based on quantization error
- [ ] Progress tracking implemented
