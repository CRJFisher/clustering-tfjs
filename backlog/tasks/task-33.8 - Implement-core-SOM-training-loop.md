## Description

Implement the main training loop with batch processing support using TensorFlow.js. Include epoch management, weight updates, convergence monitoring, and early stopping based on quantization error.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Training loop with tf.tidy memory management
- [x] Batch processing implemented
- [x] Weight update mechanism using tf operations
- [x] Convergence monitoring functional
- [x] Early stopping based on quantization error
- [x] Progress tracking implemented

## Implementation Notes

Created `src/clustering/som.ts` with complete SOM implementation:

### Core Features
- **Main SOM Class**: Implements BaseClustering interface
- **Training Loop**: Epoch-based training with mini-batch processing
- **Weight Updates**: Efficient tensor operations for neighborhood updates
- **Memory Management**: tf.tidy() used throughout for automatic cleanup

### Key Methods
- `fit()`: Main training method with convergence monitoring
- `fitPredict()`: Train and return labels in one call
- `predict()`: Predict labels for new data
- `partialFit()`: Incremental learning support (Task 33.9 foundation)

### Convergence & Monitoring
- Quantization error tracking per epoch
- Early stopping when error change < tolerance
- Progress tracking with epoch and sample counters
- Configurable mini-batch size for memory efficiency

### Additional Features
- `getWeights()`: Access trained weight matrix
- `getUMatrix()`: Calculate unified distance matrix
- `quantizationError()`: Get training quality metric
- `saveState()`/`loadState()`: Model persistence

The implementation uses TensorFlow.js throughout for GPU acceleration and includes comprehensive error handling.
