## Description

Hexagonal topology is partially implemented but needs completion. Verify grid distance calculations, neighbor finding, and ensure all operations (U-matrix, topographic error) work correctly with hexagonal grids.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Grid distance calculation verified for hexagonal
- [ ] Neighbor finding works for all positions
- [ ] U-matrix correctly computed for hexagonal
- [ ] Tests validate hexagonal topology
- [ ] Visual verification against reference implementation
