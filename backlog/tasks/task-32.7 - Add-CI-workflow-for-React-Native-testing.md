4. Install iOS simulator dependencies (macOS runner)
5. Install Android emulator dependencies
6. Set up test matrix for iOS and Android
7. Configure artifact uploads for test results
8. Add caching for RN dependencies
9. Integrate with existing CI status checks
10. Add badges to README for RN CI status
