## Description

Add mobile-specific performance optimizations including tensor management, memory efficiency, and warmup routines to ensure smooth operation on resource-constrained devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Float32 tensors used by default in RN
- [ ] Tensor reuse patterns with tf.tidy implemented
- [ ] Memory cleanup properly handles mobile constraints
- [ ] Warmup function for graph compilation added
- [ ] Batch processing optimized for mobile
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks available

## Implementation Plan

1. Configure default dtype to float32 for RN platform
2. Implement tensor pooling for frequently used shapes
3. Add tf.tidy() wrappers around all tensor operations
4. Create memory monitoring utilities for RN
5. Implement batch size optimization for mobile GPUs
6. Add warmup function to pre-compile TF.js operations
7. Optimize matrix operations for mobile constraints
8. Add performance timing hooks for profiling
9. Create memory pressure detection and adaptive algorithms
10. Test performance on various mobile devices
