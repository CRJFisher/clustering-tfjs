## Implementation Plan

### Backend Testing Strategy

1. **Create backend test suite**:

   ```typescript
   // Test each backend with same datasets
   const backends = ['cpu', 'webgl', 'wasm', 'tensorflow'];
   const datasets = [small, medium, large];
   ```

2. **Key metrics to measure**:
   - Execution time for each algorithm (KMeans, SpectralClustering, Agglomerative)
   - Memory usage peak and average
   - Tensor allocation/disposal patterns
   - Backend-specific limitations (e.g., WebGL texture size limits)

3. **Expected performance characteristics**:
   - **CPU**: Most compatible, baseline performance
   - **WebGL**: Fast for parallel operations, limited by texture memory
   - **WASM**: Good for CPU-intensive ops, benefits from SIMD
   - **tfjs-node**: Best performance in Node.js, native C++ bindings
   - **tfjs-node-gpu**: Fastest for large datasets if CUDA available

4. **Backend selection logic**:
   - Auto-detect best backend based on environment
   - Allow manual override via configuration
   - Provide warnings for suboptimal backend choices

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Tensor optimization**:
   - Use float32 tensors by default (better GPU performance vs float64)
   - Implement tensor pooling for frequently allocated shapes
   - Wrap hot loops in tf.tidy() to ensure disposal
   - Reuse tensor buffers where possible

2. **CPU↔GPU transfer minimization**:
   - Batch operations to reduce transfer overhead
   - Keep intermediate results on GPU when chaining operations
   - Use tf.keep() strategically for tensors needed across operations
   - Profile and identify transfer bottlenecks

3. **Graph compilation optimization**:
   - Implement warmup function that runs algorithm with small dummy data
   - Cache compiled kernels for repeated operations
   - Pre-compile common operation patterns
   - Document warmup best practices for production use

4. **Thread management**:
   - Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive preprocessing
   - Implement async patterns to keep main thread responsive
   - Consider tf.nextFrame() for long-running browser operations
   - Document threading patterns for different environments
