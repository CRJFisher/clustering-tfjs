## Description

Create a complete React Native example application that demonstrates how to use clustering-js in a mobile app, including visualization and performance monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Example app created with Expo or bare RN
- [ ] All clustering algorithms demonstrated
- [ ] Interactive visualizations working
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] App runs on iOS and Android
- [ ] Code well-commented for learning

## Implementation Plan

1. Create examples/react-native directory
2. Initialize React Native app with Expo or bare RN
3. Install clustering-js and TensorFlow.js dependencies
4. Create main App component with algorithm selection
5. Implement data generation utilities for demo datasets
6. Add clustering visualization using React Native SVG
7. Create performance monitoring component
8. Implement UI for algorithm parameter tuning
9. Add export functionality for results
10. Test on iOS and Android devices
11. Add README with setup instructions
