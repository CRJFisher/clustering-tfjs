## Description

Adapt file I/O operations and other platform-specific code to work within React Native's constraints, ensuring fallbacks for operations that require filesystem access.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All file-based operations check platform first
- [ ] AsyncStorage integration for persistent data
- [ ] HTTP fetch works for remote data loading
- [ ] No filesystem dependencies in RN code path
- [ ] Platform-specific code properly isolated

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify all file I/O operations in the codebase
2. Add platform checks before filesystem operations
3. Implement AsyncStorage adapter for persistent data in RN
4. Create fetch-based data loading for remote resources
5. Add abstraction layer for storage operations
6. Update data loading utilities to support RN constraints
7. Ensure no Node.js-specific modules are imported in RN path
8. Add conditional imports based on platform detection
9. Test data persistence and retrieval in RN environment
