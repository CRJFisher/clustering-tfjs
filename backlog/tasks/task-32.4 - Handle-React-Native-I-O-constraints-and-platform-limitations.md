## Description

Adapt file I/O operations and other platform-specific code to work within React Native's constraints, ensuring fallbacks for operations that require filesystem access.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All file-based operations check platform first
- [x] AsyncStorage integration for persistent data
- [x] HTTP fetch works for remote data loading
- [x] No filesystem dependencies in RN code path
- [x] Platform-specific code properly isolated

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify all file I/O operations in the codebase
2. Add platform checks before filesystem operations
3. Implement AsyncStorage adapter for persistent data in RN
4. Create fetch-based data loading for remote resources
5. Add abstraction layer for storage operations
6. Update data loading utilities to support RN constraints
7. Ensure no Node.js-specific modules are imported in RN path
8. Add conditional imports based on platform detection
9. Test data persistence and retrieval in RN environment

## Implementation Notes

### Analysis Results
- **No direct file I/O operations found**: The library works entirely with in-memory data
- **No fs module imports**: No filesystem dependencies detected
- **Process references isolated**: Only in platform detection and tf-adapter

### Created Files
- **src/utils/platform.ts**: Comprehensive platform utilities
  - Safe platform detection functions (isNode, isReactNative, isBrowser)
  - PlatformStorage class with AsyncStorage support for RN
  - Platform-safe fetch wrapper
  - No direct filesystem operations

### Modified Files
- **src/tf-backend.ts**: 
  - Now uses platform utilities for detection
  - Supports forcePlatform option for testing
  - Removed inline platform detection

- **src/clustering.ts**:
  - Uses getPlatform() utility function
  - Added React Native case in platform features
  - GPU acceleration enabled for rn-webgl

- **src/clustering-types.ts**:
  - Added 'react-native' to Platform type
  - Updated DetectedPlatform for RN detection
  - Extended backend config for RN options

### Platform Isolation
1. **No filesystem dependencies**: Library confirmed to have zero fs operations
2. **Platform checks**: All process/window checks now use utility functions
3. **Conditional imports**: Loaders selected dynamically based on platform
4. **Storage abstraction**: PlatformStorage provides unified API across platforms
5. **Fetch compatibility**: platformFetch works across all environments

### React Native Compatibility
- **AsyncStorage ready**: PlatformStorage class supports AsyncStorage when available
- **No Node.js imports**: RN loader avoids Node-specific modules
- **Memory-only operations**: All clustering algorithms work with tensors in memory
- **Platform detection safe**: Uses navigator.product for RN detection
