## Description

Implement Gaussian, bubble, and Mexican hat neighborhood functions. Create efficient distance calculations between grid neurons and neighborhood influence computation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Gaussian neighborhood function implemented
- [x] Bubble neighborhood function implemented
- [x] Mexican hat neighborhood function implemented
- [x] Grid distance calculations optimized
- [x] Neighborhood influence matrix computation working
- [x] Function parameters validated

## Implementation Notes

Added comprehensive neighborhood functions to `src/clustering/som_utils.ts`:

### Neighborhood Functions
1. **Gaussian**: Smooth exponential decay (exp(-d²/2σ²))
2. **Bubble**: Hard cutoff at radius boundary (1 if d≤σ, else 0)
3. **Mexican Hat**: Lateral inhibition ((1-d²/σ²)·exp(-d²/2σ²))

### Influence Computation
- `computeNeighborhoodInfluence()`: Standard influence calculation
- `computeNeighborhoodInfluenceBatch()`: Optimized batch processing
- `createNeighborhoodLookupTable()`: Pre-computed influence cache

### Optimization Features
- Batch processing using tf.gather for multiple BMUs
- Pre-computed distance matrices for efficiency
- GPU-accelerated tensor operations throughout
- Parameter validation to prevent invalid configurations

All functions use TensorFlow.js for GPU acceleration and proper memory management.
