## Description

Research and document the current backend configuration system in clustering-js to understand how backends are currently selected, configured, tested in CI, and documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documented where backend runtime configuration happens
- [ ] Identified all backend-related test files and CI workflows
- [ ] Found all backend documentation references
- [ ] Created list of files that need modification for RN support
- [ ] Identified patterns for backend fallback behavior

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze tf-backend.ts to understand current backend loading mechanism
2. Review existing loader modules (tf-loader.browser.ts, tf-loader.node.ts)
3. Examine test files for backend-specific testing patterns
4. Check CI workflows (.github/workflows/) for backend testing
5. Document all backend-related configuration points
6. List all files requiring modification for RN support
7. Identify fallback patterns used for other backends
8. Review package.json for backend-related dependencies
