## Description

Add support for incremental training with partialFit method using TensorFlow.js. Maintain state between training sessions, support streaming data, and enable continuous model refinement. Support loading existing model from file and saving model to file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] partialFit method implemented with tf tensors
- [ ] State persistence between sessions
- [ ] Sample counting for decay scheduling
- [ ] Mini-batch online learning working
- [ ] Streaming data support functional
- [ ] State serialization/deserialization with tf.io
- [ ] Loading existing model from file at path
- [ ] Saving model to file at path
