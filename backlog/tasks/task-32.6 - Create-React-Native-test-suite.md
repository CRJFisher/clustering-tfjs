## Description

Develop comprehensive test suite that validates all clustering algorithms work correctly in React Native environment with proper backend initialization and fallback behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test harness for RN environment created
- [ ] All clustering algorithms have RN-specific tests
- [ ] Backend initialization tests pass
- [ ] Fallback behavior properly tested
- [ ] Memory leak tests for mobile
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Implementation Plan

1. Create test/react-native directory structure
2. Set up React Native test environment with Metro bundler
3. Write backend initialization tests for RN
4. Test rn-webgl to CPU fallback scenarios
5. Create tests for all clustering algorithms in RN environment
6. Add memory leak detection tests for mobile
7. Implement performance benchmark tests
8. Test platform detection and conditional imports
9. Add tests for AsyncStorage integration
10. Create test utilities for RN-specific assertions
