## Description

The main CI test job is failing on Ubuntu with Node 20.x during the 'Run tests' step with exit code 1. This is preventing successful CI completion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Root cause of test failure identified and documented
- [x] Tests pass successfully on Ubuntu with Node 20.x  
- [x] Fix is implemented without breaking other CI jobs
- [ ] CI workflow completes successfully

## Implementation Plan

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for the specific test failure message
2. Reproduce the failure locally with Node 20.x
3. Identify root cause - likely related to tensorflow-helper.ts exports
4. Check for any Node 20.x specific behavior differences
5. Review recent changes to test setup and dependencies
6. Implement fix for the failing tests
7. Verify fix works across all Node versions
8. Update CI configuration if necessary

## Implementation Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

The Ubuntu CI test failure was caused by TypeScript errors in the tensorflow-helper.ts module. The module dynamically loads different TensorFlow.js implementations based on the environment but was not properly exporting all required properties.

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Symptom**: Tests passed locally but failed in CI with exit code 1
2. **First Attempt**: Changed to use `export = tf` but this caused TypeScript error TS2306 'File is not a module'
3. **Second Attempt**: Used `module.exports = tf` but TypeScript doesn't support this syntax
4. **Final Solution**: Combined static exports from @tensorflow/tfjs-core with dynamic property exports

### Implementation

Updated tensorflow-helper.ts to:

- Re-export all types from @tensorflow/tfjs-core for TypeScript compatibility
- Dynamically load the appropriate TensorFlow.js module based on environment
- Export specific runtime properties (io, version, data) from the loaded module
- Provide a default export for backward compatibility

### Technical Details

The challenge was that TypeScript needs to know the export structure at compile time, but we're loading different modules at runtime. The solution uses a hybrid approach:

- Static exports from tfjs-core satisfy TypeScript's type checking
- Dynamic properties are explicitly exported from the loaded module
- This ensures compatibility across all environments (Node with tfjs-node, Windows CI with tfjs, browser tests)
