## Description

Create performance benchmarks comparing TensorFlow.js SOM against reference implementations. Measure training time, memory usage, and scalability across different dataset sizes and grid configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark suite implemented
- [ ] Training time measurements documented
- [ ] Memory usage profiled with tf.memory()
- [ ] GPU vs CPU performance compared
- [ ] Scalability tests completed
- [ ] Performance report generated

## Implementation Notes

### Status: Not Implemented
This task was marked as complete in the todo list but was not actually implemented. No benchmark files were created.

### Why Skipped
- Core functionality was prioritized
- Unit and reference tests provide basic performance validation
- Memory management is tested in unit tests
- Can be added as a follow-up enhancement

### Recommended Implementation
If implementing in the future:
1. Create `test/benchmarks/som.benchmark.ts`
2. Use existing benchmark framework patterns
3. Test various dataset sizes (100, 1000, 10000 samples)
4. Compare different grid sizes (5x5, 10x10, 20x20)
5. Measure CPU vs GPU performance (WebGL/CUDA)
6. Profile memory usage patterns
