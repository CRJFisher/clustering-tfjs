## Description

Current PCA initialization is simplified and doesn't compute proper eigenvectors. Need to implement full PCA using eigendecomposition or SVD to initialize SOM weights along principal components of the data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Covariance matrix computed correctly
- [x] Eigendecomposition or SVD implemented
- [x] Weights initialized along principal components
- [x] Handles edge cases (fewer samples than dimensions)
- [x] Performance comparable to sklearn PCA initialization

## Implementation Notes

### Complete PCA Implementation
Previously, the PCA initialization was just using data mean and standard deviation. Now it properly computes principal components and initializes weights along them.

### What Was Implemented

1. **computePrincipalComponents() function**: 
   - Uses power iteration to find eigenvectors
   - Implements deflation to find multiple components
   - Works around TensorFlow.js lack of built-in eigendecomposition

2. **Proper PCA initialization**:
   - Centers the data
   - Computes covariance matrix
   - Finds top 2 principal components
   - Projects data onto PC space
   - Creates grid in PC space
   - Transforms back to original space

3. **Edge case handling**:
   - Falls back to random initialization if < 2 samples
   - Handles fewer features than requested components
   - Proper memory management with tensor disposal

### Algorithm Details
- Power iteration with 100 iterations per component
- Deflation method to extract subsequent components
- Grid positions mapped linearly in PC space
- Reconstruction via matrix multiplication
