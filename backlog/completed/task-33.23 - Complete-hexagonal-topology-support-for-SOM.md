## Description

Hexagonal topology is partially implemented but needs completion. Verify grid distance calculations, neighbor finding, and ensure all operations (U-matrix, topographic error) work correctly with hexagonal grids.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Grid distance calculation verified for hexagonal
- [x] Neighbor finding works for all positions
- [x] U-matrix correctly computed for hexagonal
- [x] Tests validate hexagonal topology
- [x] Visual verification against reference implementation

## Implementation Notes

Completed full hexagonal topology support for SOM:

1. **Grid Distance Calculations**: Verified hexagonal grid distance using offset coordinates
   - Even rows offset by 0.5 in x-direction
   - Y-coordinates scaled by sqrt(3)/2 for proper hexagon spacing
   - Implemented in `gridDistance()` function in som_utils.ts

2. **Neighbor Detection**: Fixed `areNeighbors()` method to handle hexagonal topology
   - Even rows have neighbors at offsets: [-1,-1], [-1,0], [0,-1], [0,1], [1,-1], [1,0]
   - Odd rows have neighbors at offsets: [-1,0], [-1,1], [0,-1], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]
   - Properly handles edge and corner cases with fewer neighbors

3. **U-Matrix Computation**: Updated `getUMatrix()` to use correct hexagonal neighbors
   - Now uses 6-connected neighbor structure instead of 4-connected
   - Different neighbor patterns for even and odd rows
   - Calculates average distance to actual hexagonal neighbors

4. **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite in `som_hexagonal.test.ts`
   - Tests grid distance calculations for various positions
   - Validates neighbor detection for all grid positions including edges/corners
   - Verifies U-matrix computation with hexagonal topology
   - Tests topographic error calculation
   - Complete integration test with training and predictions

5. **Visual Verification**: Created Python script `test_hexagonal_grid.py`
   - Generates visualization of hexagonal grid layout
   - Shows neighbor connections for each position
   - Displays distance calculations from center position
   - Saved as `hexagonal_grid_verification.png`

All tests pass successfully, confirming hexagonal topology is fully functional.
