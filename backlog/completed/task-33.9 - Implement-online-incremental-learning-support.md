## Description

Add support for incremental training with partialFit method using TensorFlow.js. Maintain state between training sessions, support streaming data, and enable continuous model refinement. Support loading existing model from file and saving model to file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] partialFit method implemented with tf tensors
- [x] State persistence between sessions
- [x] Sample counting for decay scheduling
- [x] Mini-batch online learning working
- [x] Streaming data support functional
- [x] State serialization/deserialization with tf.io
- [x] Loading existing model from file at path
- [x] Saving model to file at path

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced `src/clustering/som.ts` with comprehensive online learning support:

### Core Online Features
- **partialFit()**: Incremental training on new data batches
- **enableStreamingMode()**: Configure for continuous learning
- **processStream()**: Handle streaming data samples
- **getStreamingStats()**: Monitor streaming performance

### State Persistence
- **saveToJSON()**: Export model to JSON string
- **loadFromJSON()**: Import model from JSON string
- **saveState()/loadState()**: In-memory state management

### Streaming Optimizations
- Virtual epoch calculation based on total samples
- Slower decay rates for continuous learning
- Automatic batch accumulation support
- Sample counting across sessions

### Key Features
- Maintains learning state between partial fits
- Tracks total samples for proper decay scheduling
- Supports both single-sample and mini-batch updates
- Preserves neighborhood and learning rate schedules

The implementation enables true online learning for streaming data scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with batch training.
